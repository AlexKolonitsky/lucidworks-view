  Using the HTML based document template

  It is possible to alter the results you return by
  editing this document.

  You can use angular brackets {{}} to output the results
  you want within the document. For example if you wanted to
  output a field named title in on the document, you can add it by
  adding the following somewhere in the markup:
  {{dc.doc.title[0]}}

  The document root is located at dc.doc
  the field name 'title' gets that field.
  [0] gets the first item in the array. Which is fine if you only
  expect one item in that result.

  To show multiple items from a single field, you could try adding something
  like the following with your own field name.
  <div>
    <h5>categories:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li ng-repeat="category in dc.doc.category">{{category}}</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  This would create a title categories and then make a bulleted list of
  every category in that result.
